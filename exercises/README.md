# Instructions
Exercises should be completed using either the R command line or RStudio.
For each block, submit your in-class exercises to the GitHub repository as two plain-text files:

1. Rscript: using either the command line (terminal) or RStudio, produce the lines of code to complete the exercises, including your name, class, date, and question number and text (as a comment).
1. Rhistory: save all your commands from your session(s) and upload your history file to accompany your exercise script.

All exercises are due on or before the exam due date for a given block.
Use your GitHub username and block number to name your files, for example: block 1 exercises should be titled: `dt-woods_b1.R` and `dt-woods_b1.Rhistory`.
To save your work history, run the following line of code at the end of your session.

```R
# Save history file
savehistory("dt-woods-b1.Rhistory")
```

If you run multiple sessions to solve the exercises, itemize them alphabetically.

* `dt-woods-b1a.Rhistory`
* `dt-woods-b1b.Rhistory`
* `dt-woods-b1c.Rhistory`

You may then concatenate these individual files into a single history document.

Please submit only your own work.

Your instructor may test your scripts and provide feedback to you.
If you receive feedback that requests you to make changes to your script, please do so within one week of feedback.

Two of the three exercise scripts will be assessed (chosen randomly; you do not get to choose which ones).
Exercises that are submitted on time and that you fixed any problems with (based on instructor feedback) such that they produce the expected outputs and run without errors, receive a check.
Exercises that are late, incomplete, or throw unexpected errors will not receive a check.

_Be sure to test your R scripts!_

You are free to collaborate on class exercises, but you are expected to submit your own work
